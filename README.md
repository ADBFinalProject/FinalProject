# Purpose of this project

Welcome on our Final project for the Advanced database course.

The project is to build a dating app. We also need to fill it with 1000 users.

So we implemented a crawler that crawl the data from OkCupid via 2 fake accounts.

We in total collect 3000 users.

To build the application we used: Django and Neo4J.
