First you need to go on okcupid.com and create two accounts.
One male and one female
Add a file settings.py file with four (4) variables:

username_male  -> The login of your male robot

username_female -> The login of your female robot

password_male -> The password of your male robot

password_female -> The login of your female robot


You should also create a data folder where the users data will be stocked.
